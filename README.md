# LAB | Hello React

## Introduction

We just learned the basics of React and JSX and how to create a new React app using the Create React App package. We will use this exercise to practice what we just learned (and hopefully add some styles :blossom: ).

## Requirements

- Fork this repo
- Clone this repo

## Submission

- Upon completion, run the following commands:

  ```
  git add .
  git commit -m "done"
  git push origin master
  ```

- Create Pull Request so your TAs can check up your work.

## Instructions

### Iteration 1 | Create React app

Let's get started! First, you will need to create a new React app.

Navigate to the root folder of the LAB. Once in the root folder, use the Create React App (CRA) package to create a new React project. Once you have created the app, run the app in development mode.

You can reference the CRA Documentation to see how to do it - [Create React App - Getting Started](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/getting-started).

<br>

### Iteration 2 | Prepare the app

Now that you have the app created, clean up the `App.js` a bit and remove the initial content generated by the CRA. It should eventually have the following structure:

```jsx
// src/App.js
import './App.css';

function App() {
  return (
    <div className="App"></div>
  );
}
export default App;
```



Next, inside of the `src/` folder create a new folder named `images`. The folder should be nested in the following way `src/images/`. Download the following images and save them in the `src/images/` folder:



<div>

You will use these images when creating the Landing page.

### Iteration 3 | Landing Page

Finally, let's create our landing page. Using the assets that you downloaded in the previous iteration recreate the following landing page:

For now, don't worry about creating more than one component, we will cover that in the following lessons!

Happy coding! :heart:
